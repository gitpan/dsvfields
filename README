dsvfields - given stdin dsv, print fields by name

DESCRIPTION
    Essentially this can transform dsv input to strip down to something else
    This makes it easy to select fields, because you can do it by name
    instead of by position.

USAGE
    dsvfields [OPTIONS]..

       -F            don't output fields line 
       -c            comment the fields line
       -f   string   fields, separated by non word chars (limitation)
       -h            help
       -v            version

  USAGE EXAMPLES
    For these examples our data.dsv is:

       # this is a table description, it is a comment
       # the next line however, will be deemed to be the fields line
       # fields = 'name:age:occupation'
       leo   : 34 : developer
       jane  : 21 : chemist
       marco : 45 : vagrant

    Let's output age, and occupation cat data.dsv | dsvfields -f 'age
    occupation'

    Just age and then name, no fields line cat data.dsv | dsvfields -f 'age
    name'

    Same but and sort by age.. cat data.dsv | dsvfields -F -f 'age name' |
    sort

    Same but sort by name, just flip the order.. cat data.dsv | dsvfields -F
    -f 'name age' | sort

CAVEATS
    This will only work with dsv streams that have field names

    The first line must have the field names the field separator in that
    line must be the same as in the data

    Example correct field name lines with corresponding data line

       # fields = 'age name'
       leo 34
   
       # fields = "age:name"
       leo:34
   
       # FIELDS=age:name
       leo:34
   
       age name
       leo 34
   
       age,name
       leo,34
   
       age:name
       leo:34
